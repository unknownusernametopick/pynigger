## Using Beta Version


!!! note

    Features are almost always released as soon as they have been committed and checked. So there will be little difference even if the package is installed with pip.


When you install from the git master branch, you will be able to install the beta versions of the new features. You can do that using this command:

```shell
$ pip install git+https://github.com/unknownusernametopick/pynigger.git
```
